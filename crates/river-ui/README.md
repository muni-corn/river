## River

Built from the yew-wasm-pack-template. Adapted for use with
`trunk` for pure Rust instead of Webpack.

## 🚴 Usage

### 🛠️ Build

```
trunk build
```

### 🔬 Serve locally

```
trunk serve --port 8000
```

## 🔋 Batteries Included

* [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
* [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.
